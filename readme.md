# LineBlock

**LineBlock** is a Minecraft Fabric 1.20.4 mod that allows you to write and execute custom block-based scripts directly inside the game world.

With LineBlock, you can:
- Build logic using in-world blocks, similar to programming.
- Execute mathematical expressions and control structures like loops and conditions.
- Assign and modify variables.
- Use blocks to represent values of different types (INT, FLOAT, BOOL, STRING).

This mod is perfect for experimenting with programming logic directly in Minecraft â€” without typing a single line of code.
